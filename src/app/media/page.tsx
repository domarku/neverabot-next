                Wired &gt; A son&apos;s race to give his dying father artificial
                immortality
              </h3>
              <p>
                For weeks, amid my dad&apos;s barrage of doctor&apos;s
                appointments, medical tests, and treatments, I keep the notion
                to myself. I dream of creating a Dadbot â€” a chatbot that
                emulates not a children&apos;s toy but the very real man who is
                my father.
